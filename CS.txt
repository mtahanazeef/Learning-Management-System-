Importance of Punctuation
Writing formally in English is more than just choosing the right words in the right order. The importance of punctuation?
Punctuation can change the meaning of a sentence. Improving punctuation helps the reader understand you and makes the meaning clear.
Punctuation includes such marks as commas, quote marks, question marks, used in writing to separate sentences and their elements to clarify meaning. In spoken language stress, pause, and tonal changes set the purpose of the sentence.
Punctuation is essential for the following reasons:
Punctuation separates sentences.
Punctuation shows us when to pause.
Punctuation shows us where to place emphasis.
Punctuation clarifies the meaning of the sentence.
Ambiguous, unpunctuated sentences can change the meaning and confuse the reader.
Consider the following sentence without punctuation.
“The fire is in the oil can you call the fire department fine powder extinguisher is good not the fire hose splashes will cause injury.”
Can you imagine saying this sentence in a monotone during an oil fire? Without punctuation, the sentence is confusing. In this case, misinterpreted instructions could lead to death or injury.
Consider how the meaning changes depending on where you put the punctuation,
“The fire is in the oil! Can you call the fire department. Fine powder extinguisher is good, not the fire hose, it spreads burning oil!
The person finds the burning oil, then calls the fire department. Gets the fine powder extinguisher and not the fire hose.
In this example, the meaning changes if the punctuation changes.
“The fire is in the oil can. You call the fire department fine powder. Extinguisher is good,  NOT!  The fire hose it spreads burning oil.
While the person is looking for a burning oil can, he says the fire department is fine powder. He doesn’t look for the powder extinguisher. and doesn’t want to use the fire hose because burning oil will come out of it.
