Structures in C++
C++ support all the features as defined in C, but C++ has some expanded capabilities  such as data hiding, Inheritance.
In C++ a structure can have both function and variable as member(declaration)
It also declare some members as private so that they cannot accessed directly by external function.
C++ incorporates all these extension in another user defined type known as Class.

What is Class in C++
A class is a way to bind data and its associated function together.
It allows the data and function to be hidden, if necessary.
When defining class we are creating new abstract data type that can be treated as other built-in data type
